Collection of my favorite recipes

I have a lot of favorite recipes from many different sources, so I've decided to collate them into one place. My favorite food comes from the Mediterranean and Japan, so there is a heavy skew towards these two styles. I've organized the PDF by global region, and then by type of dish (fish, vegetables, bread etc). The table of contents is clickable.
