I have a lot of favorite recipes from many different sources, so I've decided to collate them into one place. My favorite food comes from the Mediterranean and Japan, so there is a heavy skew towards these two styles. I've organized the PDF by global region, and then by type of dish (fish, vegetables, bread etc). The table of contents is clickable.

If you clone this repo, you'll also need my bibtex database, which is in the Bibtex repo. You'll also need to change line 18 of the .tex file to the bibtex file path.
